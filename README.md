# NBA-Analysis
Comparing player metrics and studying NBA patterns to determine the types of players recruiters should search for.

# Dataset Used
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/drgilermo/nba-players-stats?select=Seasons_Stats.csv

## Introduction
With the rise of sports analytics, the desire for efficiency and data-driven judgments in recruiting new players for NBA clubs is increasing. We can now look at an extensive list of granular stats that range from the box score statistic, which assesses a player's impact to the team, to basic metrics like offensive rebounds, rather than merely eyeballing a player and judging their surface level playing stats (points, shot attempts, etc.). We may evaluate players using these measurements and determine who would be a good fit for a certain club depending on their attributes.

## Flow of Project

1. Data Cleaning
2. Handling Missing Data with Imputations
3. The 3 Questions and Analysis
    - What is the average career length a player has? Does it change based on the age started?
    - Which colleges produce the players with the best stats?
    - How have basketball roles changed over the years?

## Conclusion
According to the research and data, the best age range for NBA rookies to aim is 21 to 22.5 years old. Rookies in that age group have longer careers (20), however as you get older, your career length declines. Furthermore, when it comes to players with the highest "player win score" measure, players from Louisiana Tech University come out on top. When looking at metrics by position over time, it became clear that centres were having a stronger impact on the basketball court.

It was fascinating to see the relationship between the starting age and career longevity, as well as which universities came out on top and which roles are more important. It's crucial to remember, however, that correlation does not equal causation.
